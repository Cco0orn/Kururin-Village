					 <h3>Teacher Hare (Male)</h3>
				    	 <p>
					         Also referred to as PROF. RABBIT in <i>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</i>, he is Kururin's mentor and best friend. He was a co-worker of Kururin's father Totorin, before the latter became the leader of the Magic Group. He built the Action Helirins for Kururin to use in <i>Kururin Squash!</i> In <i>Kururin Paradise</i>, he went "missing" with Kururin's family (making it the only game where he had to be rescued,) but it turned out that it was a staged surprise for Kururin's birthday. Also in <i>Kururin Paradise</i>, it appears he built a Mini Helirin, but it's never used in gameplay.						 </p>
